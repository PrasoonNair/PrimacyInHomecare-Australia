1. Referral Intake & Client Onboarding
Goal: Efficiently process referrals from multiple sources and prepare for service commencement.
Sources of Referral:
•	Completed Referral Form (from email, website submission, or paper scan)
•	RFS (Request for Service) from NDIS Portal
•	Other partner referrals (Support Coordinators, hospitals, allied health)
System Requirements:
•	Upload & Pre-populate: Ability to upload referral/RFS (PDF, Word, Excel)
→ Auto-extract key data fields into participant profile using OCR/AI parsing.
•	Manual Entry Option: For cases where auto-fill is incomplete.
•	Mandatory Field Checks: Ensure required NDIS data fields are completed before progressing (e.g., NDIS Number, DOB, Plan Dates, Support Categories, Contact Details).
Workflow:
1.	Referral received → Upload into system → Auto-population → Staff verifies details.
2.	Create Participant Profile (Status = "Pending Service Agreement").

2. Service Agreement Preparation & Signing
Goal: Establish a legally binding agreement with participant/representative.
System Requirements:
•	Template Management: Multiple NDIS-compliant service agreement templates stored.
•	Pre-population: Pull participant data directly into template.
•	E-signature Integration: (e.g., DocuSign, Adobe Sign).
•	Automated Version Control: Keep signed copy in participant file with timestamp.
•	Multi-language Support (optional for CALD participants).
Workflow:
1.	Staff selects appropriate service template.
2.	System pre-fills participant details.
3.	Agreement sent electronically for signature (or printed for manual sign).
4.	Once signed → Status changes to "Pending Funding Verification".

3. Funding Verification
Goal: Confirm participant has sufficient budget in their NDIS plan to receive requested supports.
System Requirements:
•	Budget Input: Enter plan budget by category (Core, Capacity Building, Capital).
•	Automated Calculation: Deduct estimated cost of requested services from budget.
•	Alert System: Flag insufficient funds.
•	Document Evidence: Store budget verification notes.
Workflow:
1.	Staff enters NDIS plan budget & support category allocations.
2.	System checks service costs vs. available funds.
3.	If sufficient → Status = "Ready for Allocation".
4.	If insufficient → Alert & manual follow-up before proceeding.

4. Allocation to Support Worker
Goal: Match participant to a qualified and available support worker in their area.
System Requirements:
•	Staff Database: Profiles with qualifications, compliance documents, location, availability.
•	Matching Engine: Search by location, skills, language, gender preference, availability.
•	Compliance Check: Only allocate to workers with up-to-date clearances & training.
•	Hold/Confirm Function: Option to reserve a worker before confirmation.
Workflow:
1.	Participant marked as "Ready for Allocation".
2.	Allocation officer searches for matching staff.
3.	Staff contacted → Confirmation obtained.
4.	Status changes to "Meet & Greet Scheduled".

5. Meet & Greet Process
Goal: Allow participant and worker to meet before ongoing shifts are confirmed.
System Requirements:
•	Calendar Scheduling: Add meet & greet into system with notifications to both parties.
•	Feedback Form: Capture yes/no decision from both participant and worker.
•	Conditional Next Step: If match fails → Return to allocation step.
Workflow:
1.	Meet & Greet scheduled.
2.	After meeting → System records decision.
3.	If both agree → Status = "Service Commenced".
4.	If not → Loop back to allocation search.

6. Ongoing Shift Scheduling & Service Delivery
Goal: Manage ongoing support shifts throughout plan period.
System Requirements:
•	Calendar View: All planned shifts for each participant.
•	Recurring Bookings: Pre-fill shifts for the plan/service agreement period.
•	Shift Adjustments: Drag-and-drop reassignments in case of worker absence.
•	Participant & Worker Notifications: SMS/email reminders.
•	Compliance Checks: Automatic flag for expired staff clearances.
•	Mobile App Access: For workers to clock in/out, update shift notes, incident reports.
Workflow:
1.	Upon match confirmation, calendar pre-filled for service period.
2.	Service delivery team manages updates and replacements.
3.	Workers use mobile app to record attendance and notes.
4.	Shift data flows into billing/payroll module.

7. Recruitment & Staffing Management
Goal: Ensure workforce meets service demand.
System Requirements:
•	Recruitment Requests: From allocation team when no match found.
•	Candidate Pool: Track potential workers through onboarding pipeline.
•	Compliance Tracker: Police checks, WWCC, First Aid, NDIS screening expiry dates.
________________________________________

System Requirements:
•	Automated expiry alerts for worker documents.
•	NDIS compliance checklists embedded in each workflow.
•	Privacy & security protocols (data encryption, access control).
•	Audit log of all actions in the system.
________________________________________
9. Reporting & Analytics
•	Intake volumes by source.
•	Time from referral to service commencement.
•	Funding utilisation.
•	Worker allocation efficiency.
•	Incident and feedback trends.
________________________________________
10. Technical Build Recommendations
•	Platform Type: Web-based with mobile companion app.
•	Integrations:
o	NDIS portal API (if available for RFS data pull).
o	E-signature API.
o	SMS/email notifications.
