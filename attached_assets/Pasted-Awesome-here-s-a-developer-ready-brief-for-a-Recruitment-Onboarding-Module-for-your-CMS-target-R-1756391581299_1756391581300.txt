Awesome—here’s a developer-ready brief for a Recruitment & Onboarding Module for your CMS (target: Replit-hosted web app). It’s written so engineers can start building immediately while staying compliant with your NDIS/HR context.
1) Scope & Objectives
* Centralise the full lifecycle: Job Requisition → Advertising → Applications → Shortlisting → Interviews → Reference Checks → Offer & e-Sign → Onboarding → Induction → “Ready for Allocation.”
* Automate repetitive actions (screening, emails/SMS, bookings, reminders).
* Ensure auditability, compliance (AUS Fair Work/SCHADS/NDIS), and role-based access.
2) Roles & Permissions (RBAC)
* HR Recruiter: create jobs, manage ads, shortlist, schedule interviews, offers, onboarding.
* HR Manager: approve requisitions/offers, configure screening rules, view reports.
* Service Delivery Manager: read-only candidate pipeline, request hires by location/skill.
* Compliance/Quality Manager: verify screening docs, induction completion, sign-off “Ready.”
* Finance (Read-only): see FTE/cost allocations.
* Candidate (external portal): apply, upload docs, sign contract, complete induction.
3) End-to-End Workflow (states & automations)
1. Job Requisition (JR-DRAFT → JR-APPROVAL)
    * Fields: role title, award level, location(s), shift type, FT/PT/Casual, budgeted rate range, headcount, essential criteria, desirable criteria, checks required (WWCC, Police, NDIS WS, First Aid, CPR), close date, hiring team.
    * Action: HR Manager approval → creates JOB-OPEN.
2. Advertising (JOB-OPEN)
    * Publish to: CMS Careers page + Seek/Indeed (via plugin/API or export feed).
    * Auto-UTM tracking, source tagging.
    * Auto-close on date or headcount filled.
3. Application Intake (APP-RECEIVED)
    * Candidate portal form + file uploads (PDF/DOC).
    * Auto-parse CV (OCR/LLM) → fields: years experience, quals, AHPRA (if applicable), suburb/postcode, licence/car, languages, availability, NDIS experience.
    * Duplicate detection by email/phone & fuzzy name.
4. Rule-Based Shortlisting (APP-SCREEN)
    * Condition builder (no-code): IF essential_criteria = true AND distance_km ≤ X AND availability overlaps ≥ Y THEN “Auto-Shortlist”; else “Auto-Reject (reason)”; else “Needs Review”.
    * Examples:
        * Must have NDIS Worker Screening (or willingness & lead time).
        * Within 25 km of participant clusters.
        * Min 6 months community care experience.
    * Batch actions & tags: “High-fit”, “Kerala pilot”, “After-hours”.
5. Interview Scheduling (INT-SCHED → INT-DONE)
    * Candidate self-booking link (sync to Google/Microsoft calendar via ICS).
    * Modes: Phone/Video (Teams/Meet)/In-person.
    * Automated SMS/Email reminders (24h, 2h before).
    * Interview kit: structured notes template + scorecards mapped to criteria.
6. Reference Checks (REF-REQ → REF-DONE)
    * Collect referees during application or post-interview.
    * One-click email/SMS to referee survey form + option for phone notes.
    * Fraud guard (domain checks, OTP verification for mobile, IP logging).
7. Offer & Contract (OFFER-DRAFT → OFFER-SENT → SIGNED)
    * Offer builder: award level (SCHADS), base rate, loadings/penalties, allowances, location, probation, start date, documents required by Day-1.
    * e-Signature (Adobe Sign/Docusign/HelloSign or built-in): PDF contract + annexures (PD, policy acks).
    * Conditional clauses (e.g., offer contingent on verified WWCC).
8. Onboarding & Induction (ONB-OPEN → ONB-COMPLETE)
    * Smart checklist (see §7): ID check, TFN, Super, Bank, Right-to-work, WWCC, Police, NDIS WS, First Aid/CPR, Manual Handling, Infection Control, Driver Licence/Insurance, Vaccinations, Profile photo, Uniform size.
    * Induction modules (SCORM/xAPI or built-in lessons + quiz).
    * Auto-reminders for missing items; escalation to HR Manager at T+7 days.
    * Compliance sign-off: Quality Manager verifies evidence.
9. Ready for Allocation (READY)
    * Only becomes READY when: contract signed + mandatory checks verified + induction passed + availability set.
    * Sync user into Service Allocation module with tags (skills, languages, suburbs, shift limits).
4) Integrations & Plugins
* Job boards: Seek/Indeed (API/feed). If API isn’t available, support XML/JSON feed + apply-redirect with tracking.
* Email: SMTP or SendGrid/SES; template library + DKIM/SPF.
* SMS: Twilio/MessageMedia; two-way threads saved to candidate timeline.
* e-Sign: Docusign/Adobe/HelloSign (webhook for signed status & PDF).

    * Frontend: React (Vite) or Next.js (Node server in Replit).
    * DB: Replit DB isn’t enough → use Postgres (Neon/Supabase); set DATABASE_URL env.
    * Files: Backblaze/S3; set S3_BUCKET, S3_KEY, S3_SECRET.
* Background jobs: simple queue (BullMQ / RQ) for parsing CVs, sending emails/SMS, webhook handling.
* Cron: daily job to check document expiries + send reminders.
* Env Vars (examples): EMAIL_API_KEY, SMS_API_KEY, ESIGN_API_KEY, BASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, GOOGLE_CAL_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, MAPS_API_KEY.
* Webhooks endpoints:
    * /webhooks/esign/status
    * /webhooks/jobboard/apply
    * /webhooks/sms/inbound
* Testing: seed script with fake jobs/candidates; feature flags for integrations (mock mode).
