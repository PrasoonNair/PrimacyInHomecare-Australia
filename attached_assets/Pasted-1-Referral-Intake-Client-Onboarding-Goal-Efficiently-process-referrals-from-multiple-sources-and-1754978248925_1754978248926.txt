System Requirements:
Upload & Pre-populate: Ability to upload referral/RFS (PDF, Word, Excel)
→ Auto-extract key data fields into participant profile using OCR/AI parsing.

Manual Entry Option: For cases where auto-fill is incomplete.

Mandatory Field Checks: Ensure required NDIS data fields are completed before progressing (e.g., NDIS Number, DOB, Plan Dates, Support Categories, Contact Details).

Workflow:

Pre-population: Pull participant data directly into template.

E-signature Integration: (e.g., DocuSign, Adobe Sign).

Automated Version Control: Keep signed copy in participant file with timestamp.

Multi-language Support (optional for CALD participants).

Workflow:

Staff selects appropriate service template.

System pre-fills participant details.

Agreement sent electronically for signature (or printed for manual sign).

Once signed → Status changes to "Pending Funding Verification".

3. Funding Verification
Goal: Confirm participant has sufficient budget in their NDIS plan to receive requested supports.

System Requirements:
Budget Input: Enter plan budget by category (Core, Capacity Building, Capital).

Automated Calculation: Deduct estimated cost of requested services from budget.

Alert System: Flag insufficient funds.

Document Evidence: Store budget verification notes.

Workflow:

Staff enters NDIS plan budget & support category allocations.

System checks service costs vs. available funds.

If sufficient → Status = "Ready for Allocation".

If insufficient → Alert & manual follow-up before proceeding.

4. Allocation to Support Worker
Goal: Match participant to a qualified and available support worker in their area.

System Requirements:
Staff Database: Profiles with qualifications, compliance documents, location, availability.

Matching Engine: Search by location, skills, language, gender preference, availability.

Compliance Check: Only allocate to workers with up-to-date clearances & training.

Hold/Confirm Function: Option to reserve a worker before confirmation.

Workflow:

Participant marked as "Ready for Allocation".

Allocation officer searches for matching staff.

Staff contacted → Confirmation obtained.

Status changes to "Meet & Greet Scheduled".

5. Meet & Greet Process
Goal: Allow participant and worker to meet before ongoing shifts are confirmed.

System Requirements:
Calendar Scheduling: Add meet & greet into system with notifications to both parties.

Feedback Form: Capture yes/no decision from both participant and worker.

Conditional Next Step: If match fails → Return to allocation step.

Workflow:

Meet & Greet scheduled.

After meeting → System records decision.

If both agree → Status = "Service Commenced".

If not → Loop back to allocation search.

6. Ongoing Shift Scheduling & Service Delivery
Goal: Manage ongoing support shifts throughout plan period.
