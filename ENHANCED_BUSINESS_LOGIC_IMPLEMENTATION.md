*Completed: September 1, 2025*

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive business logic enhancements that transform the NDIS case management system from basic workflow processing to intelligent, automated decision-making with sophisticated compliance and quality assurance capabilities.

## âœ… Key Business Logic Improvements

### 1. Intelligent Workflow Advancement System
**File:** `server/businessLogicService.ts`

#### Enhanced Decision Making

- **Conditional Routing**: Critical cases skip standard processes (e.g., urgent referrals bypass service agreement preparation)
- **Business Rule Validation**: Comprehensive validation before each stage transition
- **Automated Action Execution**: Parallel processing of business automation tasks

#### Key Features:
```typescript
// Intelligent workflow advancement with business context
POST /api/workflow/intelligent/advance
{
  "referralId": "ref-123"
}

// Response includes:
{
  "success": true,
  "previousStage": "data_verified",
  "currentStage": "funding_verification", 
  "automationSummary": "Automated 3 business processes",
  "nextRecommendations": ["Allocate staff based on participant preferences"],
  "processingTime": 1250
}
```

### 2. Advanced Staff Matching Algorithm

#### Scoring Algorithm:
```
Overall Score = 
  Skills (25%) + 
  Availability (20%) + 
  Location (15%) + 
  Experience (15%) + 
  Cultural Fit (15%) + 
  Continuity (10%)
```

#### Enhanced API:

#### Compliance Scoring:
```typescript
// Weighted compliance calculation
Critical Issues (40 points) + 
High Priority (30 points) + 
Medium Priority (20 points) + 
Low Priority (10 points) = Overall Score
```
