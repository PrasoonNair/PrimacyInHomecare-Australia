## 📊 CURRENT WORKFLOW ANALYSIS

### 1. **Participant Journey Workflow**

#### Current Process (8 Steps):
```
Referral → Intake → Assessment → Plan Development → Service Matching → 
Service Delivery → Progress Monitoring → Outcome Reporting
```

#### ⚠️ Identified Bottlenecks:
- **Gap 1:** No automated transition from referral to service delivery
- **Gap 2:** Manual service matching taking 2-3 days
- **Gap 3:** Progress notes not linked to service delivery
- **Gap 4:** No participant self-service portal

#### ✅ Recommended Improvements:
1. **Automated Service Matching Algorithm**
   - Match based on: Location, language, cultural needs, availability
   - Priority matching for urgent cases
   - SMS notifications to selected support workers

2. **Participant Portal (Mobile-First)**
   - View upcoming services
   - Rate support workers
   - Submit feedback in multiple languages
   - Emergency contact button

3. **Smart Scheduling System**
   - Consider Australian public holidays
   - Account for travel time between suburbs
   - Respect cultural observances (e.g., Ramadan, Diwali)

### 2. **Support Worker Daily Workflow**

#### Current Process:
```
Check Roster → Travel → Clock In → Deliver Service → 
Write Notes → Clock Out → Submit Timesheet
```

#### ⚠️ Pain Points for Australian Workers:
- No offline mode for rural/remote areas
- Manual timesheet submission
- Complex progress note requirements
- No integration with myGov/NDIS portal

#### ✅ Recommended Improvements:

   - Offline data sync for poor network areas
   - GPS check-in/out with geofencing

   - Photo attachments for incidents
   ```

2. **Automated Timesheet Generation**
   - Auto-calculate penalty rates (weekends, public holidays)
   - SCHADS award compliance built-in
   - Direct integration with payroll
   - Real-time earnings display

3. **Simplified Progress Notes**
