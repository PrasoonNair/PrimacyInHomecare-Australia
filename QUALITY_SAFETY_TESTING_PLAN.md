# Quality & Safety Testing Plan - Primacy Care Australia CMS

## Overview
Comprehensive quality and safety testing strategy ensuring the system meets enterprise security standards, NDIS compliance requirements, and maintains functional integrity through continuous development.

## Security Testing Framework

  - Password policy enforcement
  - Session management
  - Multi-factor authentication bypass attempts
  
- **Authorization Testing**
  - Horizontal privilege escalation
  - Vertical privilege escalation
  - Role-based access control bypass

#### Attack Vectors Tested
```javascript
// SQL Injection Payloads
const sqlPayloads = [
  "' OR '1'='1",
  "'; DROP TABLE participants; --",
  "' UNION SELECT * FROM users --"
];

// XSS Payloads
const xssPayloads = [
  "<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
  "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>",
  "javascript:alert('XSS')"
];
