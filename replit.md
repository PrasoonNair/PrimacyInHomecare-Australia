# Primacy Care Australia CMS

## Overview

Primacy Care Australia CMS is a comprehensive case management system specifically designed for NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) service providers. The application facilitates complete lifecycle management of NDIS participants, including participant profiles, plan management, service scheduling, progress tracking, financial management, and compliance reporting. Built as a full-stack web application, it provides an intuitive interface for case managers and support staff to efficiently deliver NDIS services while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

The system now includes an advanced NDIS Plan Reader that can automatically extract participant goals from uploaded plans and provide detailed breakdowns for staff and support workers to manage their workflow efficiently.

The system features a comprehensive 9-stage workflow management system that guides referrals through the complete service delivery process: from initial referral intake through service agreements, funding verification, staff allocation, meet & greet scheduling, to service commencement. Each stage has automated tracking, compliance checks, and visual progress indicators.

The system also features a comprehensive automation engine that optimizes operations through intelligent scheduling, automated invoicing, SCHADS payroll calculations, budget monitoring, and compliance reporting - delivering significant efficiency improvements and cost savings.

The application now includes advanced quick search functionality with global search across all participants, staff, plans, services, and system features, accessible via keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd + K) or the search button in the header.

The system features comprehensive operations-level efficiency optimization with role-specific performance dashboards, efficiency tools, and automated workflow optimization. Real-time performance tracking and AI-powered recommendations help maximize productivity across all roles while maintaining quality service delivery.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built using React with TypeScript, leveraging modern development patterns:

- **Component Library**: Utilizes Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible UI components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom NDIS-specific color palette and design tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with clear separation between layout components, form components, and page-specific components. Each major feature area (participants, plans, services, etc.) has dedicated pages with corresponding form components for data entry.

### Backend Architecture
The server-side application follows a REST API pattern built on Express.js:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Database Access**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration with OpenID Connect for secure user authentication
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed session storage for scalable session handling
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints organized by resource type with consistent error handling

The backend implements a layered architecture with clear separation between routes, business logic (storage layer), and database access. The storage interface provides abstraction for all database operations, making the system maintainable and testable.

### Database Design
PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM providing type-safe schema definitions:

- **User Management**: Integrated with Replit Auth for user profiles and role-based access
